# My Favorite Plot

This github repository is dedicated to the **My Favorite Plot** project in my PY203 (Modern Physics) class.
For this project, I have written code to automate the production of space-time diagrams.

More information can be seen in the PDF that will soon be uploaded (haha nerds). The code is also well documented,
so if you feel like taking a peek at what's going on under the hood, go for it!

Note that this code only supports 1 spatial dimension and 1 time dimension for plotting as of now. Support for higher dimensions may be added in the future.
